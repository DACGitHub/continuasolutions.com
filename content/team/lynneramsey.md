        “During my career, I have had the opportunity to focus upon three key areas: design, operations and audit. The experience gained in the three strongly complement each other and help me to really appreciate project drivers, challenges and opportunities from a multitude of angles. This enables me to better understand my clients unique requirements and to suggest bespoke solutions which are not just efficient and effective in themselves but which enhance my clients existing business processes.”

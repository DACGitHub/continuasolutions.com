“As a new startup division of a larger global organization, we required the support of a subject matter expert
in the development of QHSE processes and requirements, as well as to identify where any gaps may exist that
would potentially prevent us from achieving our ISO 9001 management system certification.

After meeting with several potential advisory companies, we selected Continua Solutions as our preferred
partner. Lynne not only demonstrated a clear and immediate grasp of our requirements, but her overall
approach in addressing our needs was well-rexceived by our team. She spent a great deal of time with each of
our departments, immersing herself in our business to ensure she had a complete understanding of our needs
before making recommendations. Lynne's feedback was detailed, constructive, and presented in a manner that
was readily accepted by each of our team members receiving the information.

It has been a pleasure working with Lynne and Continua to date, and we plan to continue to lean on their
services for support going forward.”

“IronGate Energy Services hired Continua Solutions to perform their services to help our company develop a
much more in depth Quality Management System. We felt strongly that it was important to have an outsider
perform the services so we could get a true, non-bias opinion.

We met with several possible companies to perform the Gap Assessment and ended up deciding on
Continua Solutions. The IronGate team made the decision based on the initial presentation and all around
professionalism that was displayed by Lynne Ramsey. After meeting with Lynne, it was clear that she had a
complete grasp of what we wanted out of the project. She was very forthcoming with what we should expect
through the process and she was always available to answer any questions.

IronGate was, and is, very happy with the quality of work that we received from Continua Solutions and
Lynne Ramsey. I would highly recommend Lynne and Continua to any company looking to better their
company and systems.”

## Biography

    ecosystems. This, combined with her background in marine biology and
    understanding of international environmental regulations, has enabled
    her to add value to clients whether projects are in onshore or offshore
    environments.

    Her portfolio includes projects from around the world including America,
    Australia, Norway and the UK. Most recently Jenna has acted as an

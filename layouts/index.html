Since the downturn we are all finding new ways of working; we are more lean and we are, perhaps, more innovative.  Continua embraces these changes and aims to play its part in ensuring that industry experience and knowledge is neither lost, nor reduced, during this time.  To this end collaboration, networking and continual learning are at the heart of my company.  It's an exciting time to be in the energy industry and I'm proud to work with clients and colleagues who are bringing a wealth of good practice and lessons learned into the new landscape of energy production.”

“I had the pleasure of working with Lynne Ramsey on the Chevron Rosebank Project from 2012 until 2014.
During this period Lynne was responsible for, amongst other duties, collating the technical data for the Projects
Environmental Statement. This required extensive input from various Company groups in order to satisfy UK
legislation, international regulations and industry standards.

This challenging and complex effort helped lead to the successful submittal and approval by UK government,
enabling Chevron's strategic development to proceed. In addition to her wide environmental experience Lynne
proved also to be a great team member, equally admired by coworkers and clients for her thorough, methodical
and consistent approach to work tasks, as well as her collaborative, supporting and pleasant character.

I highly recommend Lynne to any project and company as a world-class professional and a great colleague,
looking forward to future opportunities of working with her again.”

  “It was a pleasure working with Lynne on the Chevron Rosebank Project. Lynne combines a well structured approach to work with an organised mind and highly creative problem solving skills which were well suited to a fast paced FEED project. Lynne is approachable and friendly, knowledgeable of safety and environmental regulations and best practices in industry, diligent and determined when it comes to preparing deliverables, giving presentations or sharing information, and generally brightens the office environment and is a pleasure to work with. I would welcome the opportunity to work with her again. ”</i>

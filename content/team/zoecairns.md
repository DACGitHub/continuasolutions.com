## Biography

<p>
    Zoë has worked in the upstream oil and gas environmental field since
    the early 1990s. Zoë’s experience spans offshore and onshore oil and
    gas exploration and drilling, offshore platform and deep-water FPSO
    developments, subsea tie-backs, major pipeline studies and onshore
    oil and gas terminals. She has a proven track record in environmental
    support to project and operations (with strong innovative/lateral thinking
    abilities) and has recently participated as a subject matter expert in a
    high-level environmental risk assessment facilitated by Continua.

    Zoë has extensive hands on experience of seeing projects from
    concept select, to FEED and EIA through to construction, installation,
    commissioning, first oil, on-going operations and through to
    decommissioning. This experience provides a solid basis for
    understanding management of environmental issues and delivery of
    practicable mitigation measures throughout a project life-cycle and
    applying lessons learned to new projects.

## Biography

<p>
    A Chartered Process Engineer with over 25 years’ experience
    in the field of environmental and process engineering. Wide range of
    experience, both technically and practically, primarily in the oil & gas
    industry but also in the provision of project management support to
    large scale civil engineering projects and the marine renewable energy
    sector.
</p>
<p>
    During his career, Steven has focused his experience on three main areas:
    offshore oil & gas production optimization, environmental engineering
    support and operations. Much of his background has therefore been
    concerned with optimization, whether it be through optimizing offshore
    separation processes or improving operational practices. The main
    driver for these activities has been to improve efficiency. This has
    allowed Steven to develop a good understanding of client requirements
    so that solutions can be identified and implemented to improve their
    bottom line.
